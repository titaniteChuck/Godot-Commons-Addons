## Tree Generator

A simple 2D node that generates a Tree with Leaves from its position. The procedural generation is fully configurable in a Resource file, so configuration for different trees can be saved

Almost all values are a random number between a [min, max] coming from the configuration object

The configuration and the node2D are a @tool script so you can hit the "generate" button from the editor
