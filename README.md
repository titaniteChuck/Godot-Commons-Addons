# General purposes addons
This repository serves for the little bits I create here and there.
Using the addons approach allows me to really separate concerns and make every addon completly independent from the others

## How to use
I recommend using the git submodule / ln approach.
In the `scripts` folder, you will find a script that does all the heavy work for you, with a README to better understand how to use it
